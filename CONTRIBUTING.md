# Contributing to Bernstein

Thanks for your interest! Here's how to get started.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sipyourdrink-ltd/bernstein && cd bernstein
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Picking something to work on

[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) says what is being built and when.

**Start here:** the volunteer workers program
([#3863](https://github.com/sipyourdrink-ltd/bernstein/issues/3863)) is
the current focus — donated AI compute working through open-source
backlogs. It is greenfield, every sub-issue is sliced to be workable on
its own with acceptance criteria written out, and design comments on
the RFC count as contributions too.

Beyond that, three labelled queues cover the rest:

- [good first issue](https://github.com/sipyourdrink-ltd/bernstein/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  — self-contained, acceptance criteria written out, no prior context needed.
- [help wanted](https://github.com/sipyourdrink-ltd/bernstein/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
  — larger, still scoped.
- [adapter](https://github.com/sipyourdrink-ltd/bernstein/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aadapter)
  — support for another coding CLI: one module, one conformance test,
  one doc entry.

Every issue in those queues states what "done" looks like before you
start. If one does not, that is a defect in the issue — say so on it.

Comment to claim an issue. If it is assigned but has been quiet for a
couple of weeks, ask anyway; stalled is not the same as taken.

Before proposing something large, read [Scope](docs/scope.md). It lists
the boundaries that are already decided and the reason for each, with
the [decision records](docs/decisions/index.md) behind them. Arguing
with a stated reason is a good way to start a discussion. Spending a
week working against one is not.

### Areas

Land three changes in one area and the area is yours if you want it -
open an issue saying so. As the area's steward you get triage access,
and every pull request touching the area is routed to you for review
automatically (`.github/workflows/area-steward-review.yml`). Areas are
adapters, the web dashboard, the terminal UI, docs, and packaging.

Stewardship starts at triage rather than write, because write access
on this repository reaches the release workflows and their publishing
credentials, and that surface is kept least-privilege. After a
stretch of established stewardship the write grant follows, and with
it your entry in [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) - GitHub only
honors code owners who hold write.

This is not ceremonial. An area with a name against it gets a second
reader who knows it; an area with nobody against it accumulates
whatever the last person in a hurry did.

## Testing

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_tests.py -x        # all tests (isolated per-file, stops on first failure)
uv run python scripts/run_tests.py -k router  # filter by keyword
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_foo.py -x -q    # single file (fast)
```

> **WARNING: Never run `uv run pytest tests/ -x -q`** - the full suite keeps references across 2000+ tests and can leak 100+ GB RAM. The isolated runner in `scripts/run_tests.py` caps each file at ~200 MB.

## Linting & type checking

```bash
uv run ruff check src/
uv run ruff format src/
uv run pyright src/
```

All three must pass before committing. No exceptions, no "fix later."

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
2. Make your changes
3. Run checks:
   ```bash
   uv run ruff check src/
   uv run pyright src/
   uv run lint-imports          # architecture contracts (adapter/core boundary)
   uv run python scripts/run_tests.py -x
   ```
4. Commit with a clear message
5. Open a PR against `main`

All non-trivial changes land via PR with at least one approving review. Security-touching changes need two approvals or operator-only push. Full process and reviewer expectations: [docs/CODE_REVIEW.md](docs/CODE_REVIEW.md).

### Docs alongside code

Every PR that adds or changes a feature MUST update docs in the same PR:

- User-visible behaviour: update the relevant `README.md` section.
- Operator workflows: update `docs/operations/<area>.md`.
- Public API surface: regenerate `docs/api/` schemas.
- Architecture or new module: update `docs/sdd/` and run `uv run bernstein agents-md sync` so AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, `.goosehints`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, and `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` stay aligned.
- New test layer: also update `docs/contributing/testing.md`.

PRs without the matching docs change will be sent back. Docs and code ship together.

### Pre-push hook

Install the versioned pre-push hook to catch lint and architecture-contract
violations before they reach CI:

```bash
ln -sf ../../scripts/git-hooks/pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push
chmod +x scripts/git-hooks/pre-push
```

The hook is **blocking** on ruff and `lint-imports`, **advisory** on pyright.
The most common architecture-contract violation it catches is an adapter
importing a scheduler-internal module, e.g.
`from bernstein.core.tasks.models import ModelConfig` (wrong) instead of
`from bernstein.core.models import ModelConfig` (canonical). See
`.importlinter` for the full contract list.

### Auto-heal on CI failure

When CI fails on `main`, the `bernstein-ci-fix` workflow
(`.github/workflows/bernstein-ci-fix.yml`) runs Bernstein in headless mode
against the failing commit, opens an `auto-heal/<sha>` branch with the
proposed fix, and creates an `auto-heal: fix CI on <sha>` PR for review.
If Bernstein can't produce a clean diff in 3 iterations within \$5, the
workflow falls back to opening a `ci-fix` issue. Auto-heal is gated by
the `BERNSTEIN_CI_FIX_ENABLED` repo variable, refuses to recurse on
`auto-heal:` PRs, and only fires for canonical-repo pushes (never forks).

## Code Style

- Python 3.12+, type hints on every public function and method
- `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of every module
- Max line length: 120 (enforced by ruff)
- Ruff rules: E, F, W, I, UP, B, SIM, TCH, RUF
- No dict soup - use `@dataclass` or `TypedDict`, not raw `dict[str, Any]`
- Enums over string literals for any value with a fixed set of options
- Google-style docstrings on all public symbols
- Async only for IO-bound code; sync for CPU-bound/pure logic
- Thin orchestration facade, isolated core logic, separate adapters

### Broad-except policy (route handlers)

`src/bernstein/core/routes/**.py` is policed by a CI lint
(`scripts/check_routes_broad_except.py`) that fails the build when a
bare `except Exception:` clause appears without a justification marker on
the line itself or in one of the three preceding comment lines.

Two markers are recognised:

- `intentional-broad-except`: legitimate best-effort path (telemetry,
  optional analytics, lineage append, etc.). The body should route any
  sensitive message through `bernstein.core.sanitize.sanitize_log`.
- `bot-ack: <short-tag>`: previously reviewed broad clause; the tag
  identifies the rationale (e.g. `bot-ack: pre-existing-1723`,
  `bot-ack: legacy-shim`).

If the clause is not actually best-effort, narrow it to the realistic
exceptions the helper can raise (typically `OSError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`,
`KeyError`, `ValueError`, or a domain-specific class). Never convert a
broad `except Exception:` into `except BaseException:` -- `KeyboardInterrupt`
and `SystemExit` must propagate.

Run locally before committing:

```bash
uv run python scripts/check_routes_broad_except.py
```

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full doctrine, including change classification, conflict protocol, and zero-tolerance failures.

## CLI Structure

The CLI is split into two layers under `src/bernstein/cli/`:

**Top-level** (`cli/`): `main.py` (Click group), `run.py`, `run_cmd.py`, `live.py`, `dashboard.py`, `helpers.py`, `ui.py`, `status.py`

**Commands sub-package** (`cli/commands/`): 70+ command modules including:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `run_cmd.py` | `bernstein run` / `-g` orchestration entry point |
| `stop_cmd.py` | `bernstein stop` graceful shutdown |
| `status_cmd.py` | `bernstein status` / `bernstein ps` |
| `evolve_cmd.py` | `bernstein evolve` subcommands |
| `agents_cmd.py` | `bernstein agents` catalog commands |
| `advanced_cmd.py` | Advanced / less common commands |
| `debug_cmd.py` | `bernstein debug-bundle` diagnostics |
| `cost.py` | Cost tracking display |
| `doctor_cmd.py` | Pre-flight health checks |
| `checkpoint_cmd.py` | Checkpoint save/restore |
| `task_cmd.py` | Direct task manipulation |
| `workspace_cmd.py` | Multi-repo workspace commands |
| `audit_cmd.py` | Audit log inspection |
| `ci_cmd.py` | CI integration commands |
| `policy_cmd.py` | Policy management |
| `triggers_cmd.py` | External trigger management |

When adding a new CLI command, create a new `*_cmd.py` module in `cli/commands/` and register it in `main.py`.

## Supported CLI Adapters

### Writing a Custom Adapter

Adapters implement the `CLIAdapter` ABC from `adapters/base.py`:

```python
class CLIAdapter(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def spawn(self, *, prompt, workdir, model_config, session_id, mcp_config=None) -> SpawnResult: ...
    @abstractmethod
    def is_alive(self, pid: int) -> bool: ...
    @abstractmethod
    def kill(self, pid: int) -> None: ...
    @abstractmethod
    def name(self) -> str: ...
    def detect_tier(self) -> ApiTierInfo | None: ...  # optional
```

Steps:
1. Create `src/bernstein/adapters/mycli.py` implementing all four abstract methods. See `adapters/claude.py` for a complete reference.
2. Register in `adapters/registry.py`: `_ADAPTERS["mycli"] = MyCLIAdapter`
3. Run checks: `uv run ruff check src/ && uv run pyright src/ && uv run python scripts/run_tests.py -x`
4. Open a PR - include a short note on how you tested it.

**Important:** All adapter `.spawn()` implementations must wrap the CLI command with `build_worker_cmd()` from `adapters/base.py`. This sets the process title and writes the PID metadata file that the orchestrator uses for `bernstein ps` and crash detection.

### Writing a Custom CI Parser

CI parsers implement the `CILogParser` protocol from `core/ci_log_parser.py`:

```python
class CILogParser(Protocol):
    name: str

    def parse(self, raw_log: str) -> list[CIFailure]: ...
```

Steps:
1. Create `src/bernstein/adapters/ci/<name>.py` from the template in `templates/ci-parsers/TEMPLATE.py`. See `adapters/ci/github_actions.py` for a working example.
2. Register: `from bernstein.core.ci_log_parser import register_parser; register_parser(MyCIParser())`
3. Run checks and open a PR.

## Writing a Custom Role

Role templates live in `templates/roles/<role-name>/` with three files:

- `system_prompt.md` - agent persona and standing instructions
- `task_prompt.md` - per-task instructions template
- `config.yaml` - default model and effort

Built-in roles: `adversary`, `analyst`, `architect`, `backend`, `ci-fixer`, `devops`, `docs`, `frontend`, `manager`, `ml-engineer`, `prompt-engineer`, `qa`, `resolver`, `retrieval`, `reviewer`, `security`, `visionary`, `vp`.

Copy an existing role and customize:

```bash
cp -r templates/roles/backend templates/roles/data-engineer
```

The new role is available immediately - no code changes required.

## Architecture Principles

- **Deterministic orchestrator** - no LLM calls for scheduling/coordination
- **Short-lived agents** - spawn per task batch, exit when done
- **File-based state** - everything in `.sdd/`, no databases
- **Pluggable adapters** - new CLI agents via `adapters/base.py` ABC
- **Branch is `main`** - never `master`
- **No monoliths** - don't create or extend god-files (>400 LOC soft, >600 LOC hard stop)

## Process management

Bernstein writes PID metadata to `.sdd/runtime/pids/`. Use those to find and stop processes. **Never** `pkill -f bernstein` or `pgrep bernstein` - it will kill the orchestrator indiscriminately.

```bash
# Correct: signal via file
echo "stop" > .sdd/runtime/signals/<role>-<session>/SHUTDOWN

# Correct: use bernstein CLI
bernstein stop

# WRONG: grep-kill
pkill -f bernstein   # kills everything including your own shell session
```
