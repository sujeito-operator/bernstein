# Adapter capability profiles

A capability profile is a machine-readable declaration of what a CLI
agent supports and how it is invoked. The profile factory turns that
declaration into a working adapter, so tracking a new agent is a data
edit rather than a new hand-written module.

Source: [`src/bernstein/adapters/capability_profile.py`](https://github.com/sipyourdrink-ltd/bernstein/blob/main/src/bernstein/adapters/capability_profile.py).

## Why declarations

Adapters used to be one hand-written module per agent. That works until
the catalogue is large: every upstream rename, flag reshuffle or project
handover lands as a source edit, so the cost of tracking the ecosystem
scales with the size of the catalogue rather than with the size of the
change.

A profile moves the per-agent knowledge into data. The parts that are
genuinely shared - worker wrapping, environment isolation, log layout,
timeout watchdog, multimodal refusal, rate-limit metering - stay in one
implementation that every profiled agent gets for free.

Agents that do not fit the declarative shape keep their hand-written
module, and agents nobody has profiled at all are still served by the
`generic` CLI adapter. Neither path changes.

## The schema

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Registry key, e.g. `pydantic_ai` |
| `display_name` | Human-readable name returned by `CLIAdapter.name()` |
| `invocation` | The always-passed CLI surface (see below) |
| `implementation` | `FACTORY` (built from the profile) or `MODULE` (declaration over a hand-written adapter) |
| `mcp_client` / `mcp_server` | Consumes MCP servers / exposes itself as one |
| `native_subagents` | Can fan work out to its own subagents |
| `sandbox` | Strongest isolation tier: `none`, `process`, `container`, `vm` |
| `local_models` | Can drive a locally-hosted model |
| `vision` | Accepts image input |
| `computer_use` | Can drive a screen, mouse or keyboard |
| `max_parallel_workers` | Concurrent workers within one session; `1` is sequential |
| `agents_md` | Reads `AGENTS.md` project instructions |
| `resume` / `dangerous_mode` / `event_channel` | The three strategy axes shared with `STRATEGY_MATRIX` |
| `provides` | Provider-name aliases for routing |

`InvocationSpec` describes the **always-passed** surface - the tokens
every spawn emits:

```python
InvocationSpec(
    binary="clai",
    model_flag="-m",
    prompt_positional=True,
    extra_args=("--no-stream",),
    env_passthrough=("OPENAI_API_KEY", "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
)
```

Flags an adapter passes *conditionally* are deliberately out of scope.
They are not part of the pinned contract, and modelling them would make
the profile-to-contract cross-check report false drift.

## Content addressing

`profile.profile_hash` is a SHA-256 over the profile's canonical JSON
form (sorted keys, primitive values, `notes` excluded - prose about a
declaration is not part of the declaration). The hash is reachable from
a live adapter as `adapter.profile_hash`.

Recording that hash alongside a run makes a changed declaration show up
as a hash divergence with a named cause, instead of as unexplained
behaviour drift between two runs of the "same" adapter.

## Two implementation shapes

**`FACTORY`** - no hand-written module exists; the adapter is built from
the profile by `build_adapter_class_from_profile`. The factory returns a
*class*, not a shared instance, so every `get_adapter()` call yields a
fresh adapter with its own resource limits and rate-limit meter, exactly
as a hand-written adapter does.

**`MODULE`** - a hand-written module owns the spawn path and the profile
is the declaration of what that module supports. This is what makes
migration incremental and opt-in: an existing adapter gains a
machine-readable capability surface without any change to how it spawns.

## Gates a profile must clear

A profile is not self-certifying. Three checks apply, and none of them
was relaxed to admit profile-built adapters.

1. **Construction-time validation.** An underspecified profile cannot
   exist: a blank name or binary, an empty flag string, a prompt with no
   delivery mechanism, or `max_parallel_workers < 1` raises
   `ProfileValidationError` (a `ValueError` subclass) at construction.

2. **Contract cross-check.** `profile_contract_discrepancies` compares
   the declared invocation surface against the pinned contract YAML
   under `tests/contract/contracts/`. A profile may declare *less* than
   the contract requires, never more - it cannot claim a binary,
   subcommand or flag the contract does not carry.
   `assert_profile_backed_by_contract` raises on any discrepancy, so a
   declaration that outruns what was verified is refused rather than
   promoted.

3. **The existing conformance suite.** Profile-built adapters are
   ordinary registry entries. They resolve through `get_adapter`, are
   enumerated by `iter_adapter_specs`, and face the same
   `tests/unit/test_adapter_consistency.py` protocol suite, the same
   strategy declaration requirement, and the same contract gate as a
   hand-written adapter.

The profile test suite additionally asserts that every shipped profile
agrees with its `STRATEGY_MATRIX` row and that no profile claims vision
that the multimodal capability table does not grant, so the declaration and
the authoritative matrices cannot drift apart.

## Capability-aware selection

`select_profile_for(requirements)` returns the first profile satisfying
a `TaskCapabilityRequirements`. A capability stronger than required
still satisfies it: a container-sandboxed adapter serves a task asking
for process isolation.

When nothing satisfies the task the call raises `CapabilityMismatchError`
rather than quietly falling back to a weaker adapter. The error carries a
`CapabilityRefusalReceipt` - a content-addressed record of the
requirements, every candidate considered with the profile hash it
presented, and the axes that went unmet:

```python
try:
    profile = select_profile_for(TaskCapabilityRequirements(vision=True))
except CapabilityMismatchError as exc:
    exc.receipt.unmet  # ("vision",)
    exc.receipt.receipt_hash  # deterministic sha256
```

The receipt hash is deterministic for a given
`(requirements, candidates, unmet)` triple, so two operators
reconstructing the same refusal derive the same identifier.

## Anchoring the routing decision

`route_and_record(requirements, audit_chain=chain, run_id=...)` is the
seam that turns an adapter selection into a replay-verifiable record. It
wraps `select_profile_for` so the decision leaves a trace in the HMAC
audit chain instead of being an unobservable side effect of dispatch:

- **On a match** it appends an `adapter.capability_selection` event
  carrying the chosen adapter and the content-addressed profile hash it
  presented. Replay recomputes that hash, so a declaration that changed
  between two runs surfaces as a hash divergence named by the adapter.
- **On a mismatch** it appends an `adapter.capability_refusal` event -
  the refusal receipt's hash, the unmet axes, and every candidate with
  the profile hash it presented - *before* the `CapabilityMismatchError`
  propagates. The refusal is a signed, chain-anchored record an operator
  can hand to a postmortem, never a silent fallback to a weaker adapter.

```python
from bernstein.adapters.capability_profile import route_and_record

profile = route_and_record(
    TaskCapabilityRequirements(mcp_client=True),
    audit_chain=chain,
    run_id=run_id,
)
```

`audit_chain` is optional: with no chain the call selects (or refuses)
exactly as `select_profile_for` does, so a dry-run capability probe stays
chain-free. The chain module is imported lazily, only when a chain is
supplied, so the adapter module's load-time import surface stays lean.

## At dispatch

The spawn path invokes the seam once the adapter for a spawn is resolved,
in `AgentSpawner._record_adapter_capability_selection`. It runs alongside
the security-floor preflight, before the adapter receives any task
context:

- For an adapter that ships a profile, the profile hash it presents is
  anchored as an `adapter.capability_selection` event, so replay detects
  a changed declaration as a hash divergence named by the adapter.
- When the task declares capability requirements the routed adapter
  cannot meet, the refusal receipt is anchored and the spawn is refused -
  a hard stop like a floor refusal, never an alternate-adapter failover.

An adapter with **no** profile (the common `claude` / `codex` / `gemini`
path, served by the generic fallback) is a no-op: nothing is anchored and
the spawn proceeds unchanged.

### Declaring task requirements

A task declares what it needs from whichever adapter runs it through the
`capability:` namespace of its `requires` list (the capability-addressing
field on the task spec). Tokens outside that namespace are skill
addressing and are ignored, so a task that declares no capability
requirement routes exactly as before:

```yaml
requires:
  - python                       # skill addressing - ignored here
  - capability:mcp_client        # needs an MCP-client adapter
  - capability:sandbox=container # needs container isolation or stronger
  - capability:max_parallel_workers=4
```

`capability_requirements_from_tokens` parses those tokens into a
`TaskCapabilityRequirements`. A boolean axis takes no value; `sandbox`
takes a tier name; `max_parallel_workers` takes an integer. A mistyped
axis raises `ProfileValidationError` rather than passing silently, so an
unenforceable requirement fails loud instead of routing a task to an
adapter that does not support it.

## Adding an agent as a profile

1. Add an `AdapterCapabilityProfile` to `_PROFILE_LIST` in
   `capability_profile.py`. Keep the declaration conservative: claim a
   capability only when the contract or upstream documentation backs it.
2. Add the contract YAML under `tests/contract/contracts/<name>.yaml`
   pinning the always-passed surface.
3. Add a `STRATEGY_MATRIX` row in `_contract.py` keyed by the same name.
4. Add a `use_cases.py` entry so `bernstein integrations list` has copy.
5. For a `FACTORY` profile, add the module to the
   `adapters-independent` contract only if you introduce a new module -
   profiles themselves add no module, which is the point.

Run `uv run pytest tests/unit/adapters/test_capability_profile.py` to
check the profile against every gate above.
