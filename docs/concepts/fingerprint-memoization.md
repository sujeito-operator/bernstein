# Fingerprint memoization

Bernstein recomputes several expensive things on every tick: cross-model
verification, knowledge-graph extraction, RAG re-embedding. Each call
site historically invented its own cache key, and most of those keys
hashed only the *inputs* - never the *function body*. A bug fix that
should re-derive the cache silently kept serving stale entries.

The `fingerprint` module replaces the ad-hoc keys with a single
content-addressed store keyed by `hash(canonicalised_input)
xor hash(function_AST)`. Change the function body, the key changes.

## Why it exists

Two failure modes drove this:

1. **Stale cache after refactor** - fix a bug, re-run, get the buggy
   result back because the cache key didn't include the source.
2. **Per-site key duplication** - cross-model verifier, knowledge
   graph, and RAG each rolled their own; they all needed the same
   invariant and none had it consistently.

## How to use it

Decorate any deterministic function whose result is expensive to
recompute and depends only on its arguments:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from bernstein.core.persistence.fingerprint import (
    default_store,
    memoize_persistent,
)

store = default_store(Path("."))  # rooted at .sdd/runtime/memo


@memoize_persistent(store, site="embed")
def embed_chunk(chunk_text: str, embedder_id: str) -> list[float]:
    # expensive embedding call
    ...
```

On second invocation with the same arguments the call is served from
`.sdd/runtime/memo/<sha>/` without re-execution. Edit the function
body, redeploy, the next call misses cache and re-derives.

The decorator is already applied at three call sites:

| Site | Key |
|---|---|
| `quality/cross_model_verifier.py` | `(model_id, prompt, output, verifier_fn_hash)` |
| `knowledge/knowledge_graph.py` | `(file_sha, extractor_fn_hash, ast_symbol_graph_source_hash)` |
| `knowledge/rag.py` | `(chunk_sha, rel_path, chunker_fn_hash, rag_source_hash)` |

## Declaring code dependencies

The function-body component covers the decorated function's *own*
source and nothing else. A thin shim that delegates the real work
elsewhere therefore keeps a byte-identical body when the code it calls
is rewritten, and its cached entries survive the fix - the exact
failure this module exists to prevent, reintroduced one level down.

Name the delegated code with `depends_on`:

```python
from bernstein.core.knowledge import ast_symbol_graph


@memoize_persistent(store, site="knowledge_graph", depends_on=(ast_symbol_graph,))
def _extract_symbols_for_memo(*, file_sha: str, rel_path: str, abs_path: str):
    return ast_symbol_graph.parse_file_symbols(Path(abs_path), rel_path)
```

Prefer passing the **module** over individual callables. A module hashes
its whole file, so the key also moves when a private helper changes, or
when a dataclass the cached value is an instance of gains a field -
neither of which a per-callable hash can see, and the second of which
would otherwise surface as an `AttributeError` on an unpickled entry.
The cost is over-invalidation: an unrelated edit anywhere in the module
rebuilds that site's cache. That is the safe direction.

The delegate does not have to live in another file. `knowledge/rag.py`
dispatches to two chunkers defined beside the shim, and the shim's body
is just as blind to a rewrite of either; it declares its own module with
`sys.modules[__name__]`:

```python
@memoize_persistent(store, site="rag", depends_on=(sys.modules[__name__],))
def _chunk_for_memo(*, chunk_sha: str, rel_path: str, source: str, is_python: bool):
    return _extract_python_chunks(source, rel_path) if is_python else _line_chunks(source, rel_path)
```

Resolve the module through `sys.modules` rather than importing the file
into itself, so the reference is the canonical module object whichever
import path loaded it first.

Omitting `depends_on` leaves keys byte-identical to the previous scheme,
so adding the parameter did not invalidate existing stores.

## Configuration

| Knob | Default | Controls |
|---|--:|---|
| `defaults.MEMO_MAX_MB` | `200` | Max disk used by the store before LRU eviction kicks in. |
| Memo store path | `.sdd/runtime/memo/` | Pinned to `.sdd/` so air-gap runs do not write to `~/.cache/`. |

Metrics exposed on `/metrics`:

- `bernstein_memo_hits_total{site}`
- `bernstein_memo_misses_total{site}`
- `bernstein_memo_size_bytes`

## Limitations

- Single host. The store is on-disk and not shared across machines.
- The fingerprint hashes the *immediate* function body only - not the
  transitive closure of called helpers. Declare the code you delegate
  to with `depends_on` (above); it is not inferred, so a call site that
  forgets it silently serves stale entries.
- `depends_on` only fires when the memoised function is *called*. A
  cache upstream of it - an incremental index that skips inputs whose
  bytes did not move, say - never reaches the memo layer at all, so it
  needs its own revision gate. `knowledge/rag.py` records
  `code_digest(rag)` in the index's `index_meta` table and reprocesses
  every file when it moves; both layers read the same digest, so they
  cannot disagree about which chunker is current.
- `depends_on` covers the declared modules, not *their* imports. A
  parser that changes behaviour because a library it calls was upgraded
  still needs manual invalidation (`bernstein cache clear`).
- Functions with hidden state (env vars read at call time, file IO,
  network calls) are unsafe to memoize. Restrict use to pure
  functions.
- The decorator does not replace `semantic_cache.py` - that's a
  vector cache for semantic-similarity lookup, a different concern.

## Cache policy engine

The `MemoStore` here is the single backing store the [cache policy
engine](cache-policy.md) composes over. A task that declares a `cache_policy`
gets a key composed from an ordered ingredient recipe (mandatory model version,
adapter version, base worktree commit, and tool schema hash, plus declared
optional ingredients), a pure drift-based freshness verdict over repo state, and
transitive eviction over `served_from` lineage edges - all on top of this same
content-addressed store.
