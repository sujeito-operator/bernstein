# A/B runner primitive

The A/B runner runs two prompt variants over the same task set,
scores each output, and emits a deterministic JSON-serialisable
comparison artefact. Synthetic and dummy executors are first-class
so the test path costs zero LLM tokens.

## Why it exists

Comparing two prompts or two adapter configurations on the same
task set is a recurring eval question: which prompt template
produces fewer regressions, which adapter produces shorter diffs,
which judge rubric correlates with merge rate. Without a primitive
the comparison is hand-rolled per question and the results are not
deterministic enough to commit.

This module is the smallest viable primitive for that workflow.
Pure functions, deterministic ordering, JSON dump with `sort_keys`
so two identical runs produce byte-equal artefacts.

## How to use it

```python
from bernstein.eval.ab_runner import (
    Variant,
    Task,
    run_ab,
)

variants = [
    Variant(name="reviewer-v1", prompt="..."),
    Variant(name="reviewer-v2", prompt="..."),
]

tasks = [
    Task(task_id="t-001", input={"diff": "..."}, expected="approve"),
    Task(task_id="t-002", input={"diff": "..."}, expected="block"),
]


def my_executor(variant, task):
    # Synthetic in tests; live adapter call in production
    return {"verdict": "approve"}


def my_scorer(result, task):
    # Returns a float in [0.0, 1.0]
    return 1.0 if result["verdict"] == task.expected else 0.0


comparison = run_ab(
    variants=variants,
    tasks=tasks,
    executor=my_executor,
    scorer=my_scorer,
)

# Comparison serialises deterministically
import json

artefact = json.dumps(comparison.to_dict(), sort_keys=True, indent=2)
```

The output carries:

- One `RunResult` per `(variant, task)` pair (output, score,
  duration, pass flag).
- `VariantStats` per variant (count, pass rate, mean score, p50,
  p95).
- A pairwise winner annotation per task so a downstream report
  can tally "v2 beat v1 on N tasks".

## Live model-vs-model A/B

For a CLI A/B comparison over a suite, use
`bernstein eval ab --suite suite.yaml --arm-a balanced --arm-b terse`.
Variant mode (`--variant-a`/`--variant-b`/`--tasks`) compares two prompt
variants offline; the runner described here covers those offline /
synthetic prompt comparisons.

## Limitations

- Benchmark loaders (SWE-bench Pro, Terminal-Bench) are out of
  scope for this primitive; they live in dedicated harnesses that
  feed `Task` instances into `run_ab`.
- The runner does not measure model cost. Wire a cost-tracking
  scorer in if cost is part of the comparison.
- Two variants per call. Higher fan-out (multi-arm bandit-style
  comparison) is a follow-up.
- Concurrency is sequential by default. The executor callable can
  fan out internally if the test path tolerates it.
